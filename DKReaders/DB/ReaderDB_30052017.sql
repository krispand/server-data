You can set up a bookshelf for each young reader in your home and fill it with the right DK Readers for your child, to enjoy over and over again. Here is a quick guide to getting the most from this app. \r\n\r\nAfter the welcome screen, you will be asked to create a parentâ€™s PIN number. This ensures your child cannot make purchases without your permission. Weâ€™ll ask for your e-mail address so if you forget your PIN we can send you a reminder. \r\n\r\nThe next step is creating a bookshelf for your child. Weâ€™ll ask for each childâ€™s name and reading level. You can adjust the level later on as your child makes progress. Get access to books directly from your bookshelf. Tap the â€œadd bookâ€ button and choose either the bookstore, or from titles your family has already purchased. \r\n\r\nThe DK Reader Bookstore contains a library of ebooks at five different reading levels to browse and buy. You can tap on a title to bring up a short summary about the ebook, and download a sample to browse for free. New ebooks will be added to the Bookstore every month. If you decide to purchase the ebook, you will be asked for your PIN to proceed. Itâ€™s that simple.\r\n\r\nNow itâ€™s over to your DK Reader. In the Bookstore, your child can browse through the ebooks with you and add titles to a wish list. When opening his or her bookshelf, your child can choose from a series of pictures to personalize the shelf. \r\n\r\nGet reading! Tap a book to open it. Your child can enable the read-aloud feature and set the volume, and choose whether or not to turn the pages. Mini-pages at the bottom of the screen show where your child is in the ebook. Finished? Click a button and let your parents know. Parents can access a page to see what their child has been reading, review purchases, reset PIN, and restore any purchases that may no longer be viewed. The DK Reader App is easy to use, and an easy way to get your child reading with confidence.\r\n\r\nFor questions or queries please contact customerservices@dk.com', 1, 'LIVE', '2013-11-12 10:27:03', '2014-02-24 09:59:22'),

Download the free book sample and discuss the contents with your child to heighten interest. If there are unfamiliar or difficult words in the sample, work them out. Chat about the non-fiction reading features used in the book, such as headings and captions.\r\n\r\nSupport your child while reading the story\r\nLet your child read and scroll through the pages of the DK Reader. Where necessary, encourage your child to break a tricky word into syllables. Sound out each one and then flow them together. Ask your child to reread the sentence to check the meaning. Itâ€™s a great idea to encourage your child read out loud to you. When there is a question mark or exclamation mark, encourage your child to vary the voice while reading.\r\n\r\nPraise, share, chat\r\nTry and share a book together every day.
